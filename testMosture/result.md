**Description**  
- Workshop step 8
- Test if the circuit works or not
- The output value represents the mositure of the soil, which changes according to the resistance between the nails
- The moisture value can be shown on Serial monitor and plotter


**Results**  
Nails in air: Sensor = 5-8  
Nails in soil: Sensor = 80-90  
Nails touch together: Sensor = 800-850
